        Returns the contents of the specified file attachment.

        Note that this endpoint does not return a JSON response, but instead
        returns a redirect pointing to the actual file that in turn will return
        the raw contents.

        The redirect URL contains a one-time token that has a limited lifetime.
        As a result, the link should not be persisted, stored, or shared.
